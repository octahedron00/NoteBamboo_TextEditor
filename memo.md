## Making a rich text editor, only with Java

Many of android rich text editor are based on other languages...

That must be because work with languages like JavaScript must be easier,

and that must be because of spans in java are so complicated, and not fully supported all html tags.

### I tried to edit the HTML first...

That's because Spans in Java look so hard and complicated.

But I couldn't find the way to deal with texts and tags at the same time...

If it is possible, it'll be easier to make rich text editor.

Writing tags for make the text rich was not what I wanted.

So I was struggling to find the way.

### Maybe using tags are better...

Not only the real tags, but also just supporting some mark up language(like markdown) will be also better... just maybe:)
